#### FusionUI installation:
```bash
    npm install --save @ironsource/fusion-ui
```

All FusionUI components were built in Angular (Version 14), which means you'll get all Angular abilities by working with FusionUI & Angular.

Import the required FusionUI module and add it to your module imports array:

```ts
import {CommonModule} from '@angular/common';
import { ToastModule } from '@ironsource/fusion-ui/components/toast/v2';

@NgModule({
    declarations: [ExampleComponent],
    imports: [CommonModule, ToastModule]
})
export class ExampleModule {}
```
Then you can add the component tag into the template:

```html
<fusion-toast *ngIf="shown"
    [configuration]="toastConfig"
    (toastClosed)="onToastClose('baseToast')"
></fusion-toast>
```
For standalone component:

```ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
import { ToastModule } from '@ironsource/fusion-ui/components/toast/v2';
import { ToastEntity } from '@ironsource/fusion-ui/components/toast/common/entities';

@Component({
  selector: 'your-standalone-component',
  template: `<fusion-toast *ngIf="shown"
                [configuration]="toastConfig"
                (toastClosed)="onToastClose('warningToast')"
            ></fusion-toast>`,
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule, ToastModule],
})
export class FusionStoryWrapperComponent {
  shown = true;
  toastConfig: ToastEntity = {
        type: 'warning',
        text: 'Better check yourself, youâ€™re not looking good'
    };

  onToastClose(toastKey: string) {
    console.log('Toast to close: ', toastKey);
    this.shown = false;
  }
}
```
